NAME
    JSON::Diffable - A relaxed and easy diffable JSON variant

SYNOPSIS
        use JSON::Diffable qw( encode_json decode_json );

        $json = encode_json $data;
        $data = decode_json $json;

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows to create a JSON variant that is suitable for easy
    diffing. This means:

    *   Commas after each hash or array element.

    *   Consistent indentation

    *   One line per entry

    The data can be read again by a relaxed JSON parser or the exported
    "decode_json" function.

EXPORTS

        my $json = encode_json($data);

    Turns a Perl data structure into diffable JSON.

  decode_json
